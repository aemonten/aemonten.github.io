I’m Alejandro Montenegro-Montero, a molecular biologist and Executive Editor at [Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL)]([https://www.cshl.edu/]) Press. My research was focused on gene expression regulation, specifically, on the characterization of transcriptional regulatory networks in eukaryotes. During my Ph.D., I studied gene regulation in response to stressful conditions, using the filamentous fungus *N. crassa* as a research system. In addition, I focused on how the circadian clock controls daily rhythms in gene expression in this organism.

I did my Ph.D. and subsequent postdoctoral work at the P. Universidad Católica de Chile, Chile, after which I did a short postdoctoral stay at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, USA, before starting my career in scientific publishing as a full-time scientific editor.

As an editor, I led *Health Science Reports*, a general medical journal, as Chief Editor, and then joined *Current Protocols*, where, as Senior Editor, I ran the molecular biology, plant biology, and toxicology sections, and worked with multiple corporate partners to develop free tools and resources for researchers. Currently, as Executive Editor at CSHL, I oversee [*CSH Protocols*]([https://cshprotocols.cshlp.org/]) and run the laboratory manuals program. In addition, I lead the “Integrity in Publishing Group”, providing support and advice for CSHL Press colleagues, editors, and societies on publishing best practices and the handling of integrity concerns. Further, I support the preprint server bioRxiv as part of the [bioRxiv Affiliates program]([https://www.biorxiv.org/about-biorxiv]).

I’m also the Scientific Chair of the biennial “Molecular Biosystems” Conference on Eukaryotic Gene Regulation & Functional Genomics ([http://www.molbiosystems.com]([http://www.molbiosystems.com])), the leading conference in the field in Latin America.

Lastly, I help researchers by providing manuscript editing services. If you are interested, please reach out.
